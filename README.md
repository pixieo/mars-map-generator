# Mars exploration - Map Generator

This application generates randomized maps of Mars, based on input requirements. 

There are four types of objects: mountains (^), pits (#), minerals (*), and pockets of water (~). 
The first two are patch-like terrain elements (covering a 2D continuous area on the map), the latter two are point-like resources (covering just one pixel on the map).
